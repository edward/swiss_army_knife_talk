I'm giving a talk at PyCon next month called "Systems programming as a swiss
army knife". Almost all of my talks start off as blog posts, so, let's start!

It's at PyCon, which is meant to be a Python programming conference. The
talk I'm going to give has nothing to do with Python.

You have an operating system on your computer, every single program you write
is constantly interacting with it, and there are tons of generic tools you can
use to get it tell you what it's up to. So we're going to **make friends with
our operating system**.

The operating system I'll talk about here is Linux, because practically every
machine I use runs Linux, and in any case it's all I know about.

### What does your operating system do for you?

When you go to http://google.com, your operating system

### strace

* blah blah blah

So, let's talk about things your operating system knows, and how you can ask for them

### Which files are open? (lsof)

Is `mount` telling you that 

### Wk

### iostat




Instead it's a talk
about systems and Linux and how better understanding your operating system
makes you a better programmer.


And to me it actually feels weird to go to a Python conference and watch a
whole bunch of Python talks, because, honestly, I don't really care that much about
Python. It's probably maybe the language I'm the most comfortable
